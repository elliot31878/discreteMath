# Discrete Mathematics Application

This application, developed in Python, explores the field of Discrete Mathematicsâ€”a branch of mathematics that studies structures that are countable, distinct, and separable. Examples of discrete structures include combinations, graphs, and logical statements. These structures can either be finite or infinite, and this application provides tools and resources to work with them.
